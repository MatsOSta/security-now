Security Now 888: The EvilProxy Service
URL : https://twit.tv/shows/security-now/episodes/888
• What the main point was
With 2hours of runtime, several things can stand out as main points, however the titular The EvilProxy Service debuing phishing as a service is the main point, with cyberwar escalation between Albania and Iran a notable second.
• What you learned
Albania ending diplomatic communications with Iran, while being backed by NATO allies, marks one of the first true real world escalations after a cyber attack. Strong attribution was neccasary and several tech giants where involved in the attribution process, however this attribution was then used to justify real world actions to a bigger degree than previously seen. closing an embassy with 1 days notice, and raiding the facilities are big actions and precedents.

The EvilProxy Service is the natural evolution of the Ransomware as a service.
simular to ransomeware as a services, the EvilProxy Services is an easy to use payed subcription for advanced phising campaigns. 
These phising campaigns use proxy teqniques to hijack 2 factor identification and log inn with full user access.
the mirrored sites are also practicly impossible to detect unless very strict url scrutiny is employed. (and in some cases the difference might be practicly invisible to the human eye)
• Why you chose this podcast and episode
Security Now forms part of my weekly podcasts rotation, I've listened to it since the first year tutorial called for finding podcast and materials. I enjoy the strongly opinionated and informed voice of Steve Gibson in the security realm.
